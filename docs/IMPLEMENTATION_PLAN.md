# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased development approach for the Isame Load Balancer project.

## Development Phases

### Phase 0 - Bootstrap âœ…

**Status: COMPLETED**

- [x] Project setup and basic HTTP server
- [x] Development tooling (Makefile, linting, testing)
- [x] Basic testing structure
- [x] Project structure established
- [x] Basic HTTP server with health endpoint

**Deliverables:**

- Basic HTTP server responding on port 8080
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Service information endpoint (`/`)
- Build system with Makefile
- Go module setup
- Linting configuration with golangci-lint
- Basic CLI tool stub

### Phase 1 - MVP HTTP Load Balancer (Planned)

**Objective:** Create a minimal viable HTTP load balancer with basic functionality

**Features:**

- [ ] Configuration system (YAML)
- [ ] HTTP reverse proxy functionality
- [ ] Round-robin load balancing algorithm
- [ ] Active health checking for backend servers
- [ ] Basic metrics collection (Prometheus format)
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling

**Technical Requirements:**

- YAML-based configuration file
- Support for multiple backend servers
- Health check endpoints for backends
- Request forwarding with proper headers
- Basic logging and metrics

### Phase 2 - Advanced Features (Planned)

**Objective:** Add production-ready features and reliability improvements

**Features:**

- [ ] Multiple load balancing algorithms (weighted round-robin, least connections)
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for failing backends
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Rate limiting capabilities
- [ ] SSL/TLS termination
- [ ] Request/response middleware system

**Technical Requirements:**

- Pluggable load balancing algorithms
- Circuit breaker with configurable thresholds
- Configurable retry policies
- Token bucket or sliding window rate limiting
- TLS certificate management
- Middleware pipeline architecture

### Phase 3 - Control Plane (Planned)

**Objective:** Add management and observability features

**Features:**

- [ ] REST API for runtime configuration management
- [ ] Enhanced CLI tool (`isame-ctl`) with full functionality
- [ ] Distributed tracing integration
- [ ] Advanced observability (custom metrics, dashboards)
- [ ] Configuration hot-reloading
- [ ] Admin dashboard (web UI)

**Technical Requirements:**

- RESTful management API
- OpenTelemetry integration for tracing
- Prometheus metrics with custom collectors
- Configuration validation and hot-reload
- Web-based admin interface
- Enhanced CLI with subcommands

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 0 Achievements

- Established clean project structure following Go conventions
- Implemented basic HTTP server with timeout configurations
- Created both main server binary (`isame-lb`) and CLI tool (`isame-ctl`)
- Set up comprehensive development tooling
- Configured static analysis and code quality tools

### Next Steps (Phase 1)

1. Design configuration schema for backend servers
2. Implement HTTP reverse proxy functionality
3. Add backend health checking
4. Implement round-robin load balancing
5. Add basic metrics collection
6. Create comprehensive test suite

### Technical Decisions

- **Language:** Go (chosen for performance and concurrency features)
- **Configuration:** YAML format for human readability
- **Metrics:** Prometheus format for observability
- **Testing:** Go's built-in testing framework with race detection
- **Linting:** golangci-lint with comprehensive rule set
