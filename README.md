# Isame Load Balancer

A high-performance HTTP load balancer written in Go, following a phased development approach.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Phase 0 - Bootstrap** (Current)

- âœ… Project structure established
- âœ… Basic HTTP server with health endpoint
- âœ… Development tooling (Makefile, linting, testing)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later
- Make (optional, but recommended)

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build the project
make build

# Run the load balancer
make run

# Or run directly after building
./bin/isame-lb
```

The load balancer will start on port 8080 by default.

### Development

```bash
# Setup development environment
make dev-setup

# Run tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Format code
make fmt
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint (returns 200 OK)
- `GET /` - Basic service information

### Example

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Get service info
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 0 - Bootstrap âœ…

- [x] Project setup and basic HTTP server
- [x] Development tooling
- [x] Basic testing structure

### Phase 1 - MVP HTTP Load Balancer (Planned)

- [ ] Configuration system (YAML)
- [ ] HTTP reverse proxy
- [ ] Round-robin load balancing
- [ ] Active health checking
- [ ] Basic metrics (Prometheus)

### Phase 2 - Advanced Features (Planned)

- [ ] Multiple load balancing algorithms
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Retry logic
- [ ] Rate limiting

### Phase 3 - Control Plane (Planned)

- [ ] REST API for management
- [ ] Enhanced CLI tool
- [ ] Distributed tracing
- [ ] Advanced observability

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./internal/config
```

## Contributing

This project follows SOLID principles and emphasizes clean, testable code. See the development phases for planned features.

### Code Style

- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use golangci-lint for static analysis
